<b>2 Months later</b>
<p>It's been two months since I started my digital minimalist journey, and I have to say, it's been quite a ride. I've been more productive, focused, and overall happier. I started writing a docs website, because I feel like all the knowledge should be accessible to even the newbiest of newbies in the field.</p>
<p>I've also been reading a lot more books and spending more time with my family. I've realized that I don't need to be constantly connected to the digital world to be happy. Allthough I am back on Discord, I am not as active as I used to be. I've also been more mindful of my screen time and have set boundaries for myself.</p>
<p>But yeah this is it for this month's update. If there will be any changes, I'll let you know. Until then, stay safe and take care!</p>
