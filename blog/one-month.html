<b>1 Month later</b>
<p>So, it's been a month, and I know that a promise was made to post again the other week. So yeah progress report! I genuinely stopped caring about what's happening on social media. I also noticed my attention span has recovered and I got into reading books. I never thought that books can be more fun than YouTube and snapping people my wall. Might as well start a course on this type of thing. But yeah I think a better way to improve this is to structure all this more properly.</p>
<p>Anyways see y'all next month!</p>
