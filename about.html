<p>My name is Chloe, a 19-year-old computer science and computer engineering student based in Slovenia. I’ve always been drawn to tech, which naturally led me to not only study CS/CE but also getting into the world of open-source, where I maintain and contribute to FOSS projects.

Outside of tech, I’m a bit of an old soul in a young body — people say I connect better with those much older than me, and honestly, I kind of feel that too. I love building cozy spaces around me, both digitally and physically. My room reflects that with its manga walls, plants and a soft aesthetic that makes me feel at home.

But life hasn’t always been smooth. I've dealt with challenges like ADHD, nicotine addiction, and the struggle to stay focused in a world full of distractions. Still, I’m resilient — slowly shaping my habits around deep work, digital minimalism, and living more intentionally.

Right now, I’m balancing my studies, my projects, and even starting to build a small business making personal websites. My dream? To retire early, maybe by 50, and spend life on my terms. I'm still figuring things out, but every day I’m getting a little closer to the life I envision — cozy, intentional, and fully mine.
